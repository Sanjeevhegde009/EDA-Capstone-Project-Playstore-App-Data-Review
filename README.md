# EDA-Capstone-Project-Playstore-App-Data-Review
This Project gives you an insight into the data obatined on Playstore apps and User responses apart from statistical Facts
DESCRIPTION:

Play store is the official app store for devices running on android platform 
developed by Google LLC. The platform lets android users download and install 
secure apps developed by various developers or companies. Several invaluable 
insights can be drawn from analysis of data available on the Play Store. In this 
project, We are provided with two data sets, one containing publicly available 
information such as average ratings, number of reviews etc. while other data set 
contains processed data of user reviews based on the sentiments in the review.
 As an initial step to EDA on the given data sets, data cleaning and essential 
modifications have been performed on the data sets wherein, misaligned values 
have been arranged appropriately, NaN values in numeric data have been replaced 
by their median values or Mode values or have been dropped accordingly. Further, 
Categorical values in the data set have been replaced by their mode values, 
quantified values of the data were assigned with appropriate Units of 
measurement, non-essential characters such as commas and “+” etc. were 
cleaned. Also, Columns have been converted to the appropriate data types while 
unimportant columns with already processed data were removed from the data 
set.
Several meaningful insights were drawn from the Exploratory Data Analysis of 
the two data sets. Among 9701 unique apps, it can be noted that Family category
of apps are mostly present in the data set followed by Games category. Average 
Ratings for apps is about 4.2 stars while average size of apps is about 16 MB.
Also, Games category apps were most installed by the users while all category of 
apps had above 4 star rating. Users have tendencyto install apps with more 
reviews in comparison to apps with lesser reviews. Further, apps with size less 
than 25MB were most installed. Data sets mostly contain apps developed and 
rated mostly for everyone. Paid apps reviews are more of positive sentiments 
compared to free apps. Also, paid app reviews are slightly subjective in nature 
compared to free apps wherein paid apps reviews also contain extremely 
subjective as well as objective reviews as compared to free app reviews.
From the above analysis, several insights have been drawn and are of great help 
to the developers in design and development of apps, their pricing models and 
thereby impacting the revenue generated from the app
